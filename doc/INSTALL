Lgp Installation Notes
======================

Debian
------
* unpack logilab-packaging
* add pbuilder as a valid sudo command for developpers
* edit the /etc/lgp/pbuilderrc file with your default values
  adapt these variables:
  - BASETGZ
        location of the pbuilder chrooted images
        the path should really exists
  - DEBIAN_SUITES / UBUNTU_SUITES
        codenames to adapt for the debian-like distribution
  - DEBIAN_MIRROR / UBUNTU_MIRROR
        master mirror of the distribution
  - DEBIAN_SOURCESLIST / UBUNTU_SOURCESLIST or DEBIAN_OTHERMIRROR / UBUNTU_OTHERMIRROR
        dynamic sources.list (using $DIST) or use the standard pbuilder format (with pipes)
* edit the /etc/lgp/sources.list.* files if DEBIAN_SOURCESLIST and UBUNTU_SOURCESLIST are used
* create pbuilder images with "lgp setup -c create"
* you need to add sudo privilege for pbuilder command and DIST environment variable

Note: you can easily remove basetgz of any created pbuilder images.
